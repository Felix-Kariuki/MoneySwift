# MoneySwift - I&M Mobile Code Test 

MoneySwift is a (fictitious) Fintech company that provides an e-commerce solution

You are tasked with creating a basic Android app that simulates a simple e-
commerce platform. The app should display a list of products (at least 3-5 items)

and allow the user to select products and proceed to a checkout screen where
they can enter payment information via Stripe.

The app displays a list of 5 products from a local listings.json generated from the fakestore API 


## Features
 - Products List
 - Check out
 - Stripe Intergration

## Prerequisites

1. Android studio - Iguana +
2. test device an android device either simulator or physical device
3. Stripe test creds -  I have provide the test creds i used to test build the project. The cres can be found in the `domain` module under the `utils` package in the `Constants` File
   If you wish to replace the creds with your own then fonf the Constants file and replace with your own. 

```KOTLIN
 const val SECRET_KEY = "SECRET_KEY_HERE"

 const val PUBLISH_KEY = "PUBLISH_KEY_HERE

 const val AUTHORIZATION = "Bearer $SECRET_KEY"

 const val BASE_URL = "STRIPE_BASE_URL_HERE"

```

  ### How to run

[APK Link]() - To install directly the apk without running the project On the IDE find the attched apk

#### Running on IDE
Clone the project and open it with android studio. Once the necerssary libraries have been downloaded run the project an install to your testing device

## **Tech stack & Libraries üõ†Ô∏èüë®‚Äçüíª**
 - [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/) - Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin's standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise
 * [Jetpack Components:](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture?gclid=Cj0KCQjw8O-VBhCpARIsACMvVLOH1satX45o9f4PMQ4Sxr7bG9myl6-KZL9nYda8PJsHV7m2uJL8bzgaAmqiEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)
    * [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose?gclid=Cj0KCQjwhqaVBhCxARIsAHK1tiMMwHsxQ8Z25jyEdtLha9erq11wROoEfL6RqpGMprgbDTNuMO3_Ri8aAu5EEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) -  Android‚Äôs modern toolkit for building native UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android
    * [View Model](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)-  store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way.
    * [Lifecycle]( https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle) - Perform actions in response to a change in the lifecycle status of another component, such as activities and fragments.
    * [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata.html) - A lifecycle-aware data holder with the observer pattern
    * [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx.html) - Android KTX is a set of Kotlin extensions that are included with Android Jetpack and other Android libraries. KTX extensions provide concise, idiomatic Kotlin to Jetpack, Android platform, and other APIs.
    * [AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx) - Major improvement to the original Android [Support Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/index), which is no longer maintained.


* [Dagger-Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/)- a dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in your project

* [Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) - a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously
* [Flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow)- In coroutines, a flow is a type that can emit multiple values sequentially, as opposed to suspend functions that return only a single value.

* [CI/CD](https://codemagic.io/android-continuous-integration/) - Continuous integration systems let you automatically build and test your app every time you check in updates to your source control system. 

* [Coil](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/compose/) - Image Loader library.

 * [Compose Navigation]()
 * [Stripe Android SDK](https://docs.stripe.com/libraries/android) - The Stripe Android SDK allows you to quickly build a payment flow in your Android app. We provide powerful and customisable UI elements that you can use out-of-the-box to collect your users‚Äô payment details. We also expose the low-level APIs that underpin those UIs so that you can build fully custom experiences.

## Modularization and project struecture
The project is modularized by layer as a way of showcasing the power of project modularization and separation of concerns.The modules are:
- presentation - 
- data - 
- domain - 
- shared - 
- designSystem -
